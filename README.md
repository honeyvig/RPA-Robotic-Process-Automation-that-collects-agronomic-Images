# RPA-Robotic-Process-Automation-that-collects-agronomic-Images
Software needs to be created to automate the search and collection of images on the web using terms related to each specific nutrient deficiency, pest, disease and fungus. The system should search, download and store these images in folders organized according to the corresponding category, ensuring that the images are of sufficient quality for later use in training an artificial intelligence model. The application must be able to access multiple global search engines and ensure that the images collected are of high resolution and relevance.
The collected images will be used to train an artificial intelligence model, whose purpose will be the detection and diagnosis of nutritional deficiencies, pests, diseases and fungi in different crops. To support the development, examples of images already catalogued by experts in each area will be provided.
The application must be able to perform searches in the main search engines (Google, Bing, Yahoo, among others).
Organize the images in folders according to their category (deficiencies, pests, diseases, fungi).
Verify the quality of the images to ensure that they are suitable for AI training.
The solution must integrate algorithms to detect duplicates or images that do not meet quality requirements.
It must be able to handle large volumes of data and high-resolution image downloads.
The interface should be intuitive and allow the user to monitor the progress of image collection and storage.
The ideal candidate for this role should have:
Experience in developing RPA applications and using automation technologies for the web.
Advanced knowledge in handling search engine APIs and web scraping techniques.
Ability to work with image processing and verification tools, ensuring image quality and resolution.
Ability to manage large volumes of data and image files.
Knowledge in artificial intelligence, preferably in computer vision systems, to understand the context of image usage.
Skill in organizing files and data efficiently.
Familiarity with automation tools and libraries such as Selenium, Puppeteer, or others.
==============
Python-based solution for your software requirements, using libraries like Selenium for web automation, Requests for downloading images, OpenCV for image quality checks, and os for file management. The software will:

    Search for Images using search engine APIs and web scraping (e.g., Selenium).
    Download and Store Images into organized folders.
    Verify Image Quality for resolution and relevance.
    Detect and Remove Duplicates to ensure dataset integrity.
    Handle Large Volumes of data efficiently.
